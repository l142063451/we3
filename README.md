# WE3: Infinite-Superposition Bits Physics/Mathematics Reframing

A rigorous research project exploring mathematically sound re-formulations of physics and mathematical models to enable compact representation of infinite solution spaces with near-constant query latency.

## Project Overview

This project implements multiple mathematical frameworks to investigate the possibility of encoding extremely large or effectively infinite solution spaces in compact, verifiable representations. All work follows strict scientific integrity protocols with machine-checked proofs, reproducible experiments, and peer review requirements.

## Mathematical Frameworks

- **Generating Functions & Analytic Combinatorics**: Rational and algebraic GF engines
- **Knowledge Compilation**: CNF to d-DNNF/SDD/OBDD transformations
- **Tensor Networks**: Low-rank decompositions and contraction planning
- **Symbolic/Algebraic Methods**: Gröbner bases and elimination theory
- **Probabilistic ML Hybrids**: Surrogate models with formal verification

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable) - for high-performance mathematical cores
- Python 3.9+ - for experimentation and notebooks
- Poetry - for Python dependency management
- Lean 4 or Coq - for formal proof verification
- Docker - for reproducible environments

## Scientific Methodology

All contributions must follow our rigorous scientific protocols:

1. **Evidence Classification**: Every claim labeled as PROVEN, VERIFIED, HEURISTIC, or SPECULATIVE
2. **Multi-pronged Validation**: Symbolic derivation + machine-checked proofs + numerical experiments + cross-method verification
3. **Reproduction Requirements**: Full provenance tracking with seeds, versions, and hardware details
4. **Peer Review**: Independent replication before any extraordinary claims

## Safety and Ethics

- No fabricated experiments or proofs
- Human sign-off required for claims affecting fundamental physics
- Theoretical/simulation research only - no unsafe hardware implementations
- Complete transparency in limitations and negative results
