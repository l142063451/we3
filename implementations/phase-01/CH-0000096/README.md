# Challenge CH-0000096: Distributed Systems #96

**Category:** SYSTEM  
**Difficulty:** TRIVIAL  
**Estimated Time:** 1h  
**Owner:** phase-01  

## Description

Consensus algorithms, distributed storage, replication (Challenge CH-0000096)

## Success Criteria

- Consensus correctness
- Fault tolerance

## Verification Method

INTEGRATION_TEST

## Dependencies



## Tags

distributed, consensus, replication

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - This challenge is currently a stub that fails intentionally.

## Usage

```bash
# Run the challenge (will fail until implemented)
./run.sh

# Verify the implementation (will fail until implemented) 
./verify.sh
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Replace the stub in `run.sh` with actual algorithm implementation
2. Add comprehensive unit tests with verification
3. Measure and report performance metrics
4. Provide formal verification where applicable
5. Ensure all success criteria are met
6. Update result.json with actual measurements
