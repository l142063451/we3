# Challenge CH-0000073: Performance Monitoring #73

**Category:** SYSTEM  
**Difficulty:** EXTREME  
**Estimated Time:** 1w  
**Owner:** phase-01  

## Description

System metrics collection and analysis tools (Challenge CH-0000073)

## Success Criteria

- Accurate measurements
- Low overhead monitoring
- Formal verification of correctness properties
- Performance analysis with complexity bounds

## Verification Method

BENCHMARK

## Dependencies



## Tags

performance, monitoring, metrics

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - This challenge is currently a stub that fails intentionally.

## Usage

```bash
# Run the challenge (will fail until implemented)
./run.sh

# Verify the implementation (will fail until implemented) 
./verify.sh
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Replace the stub in `run.sh` with actual algorithm implementation
2. Add comprehensive unit tests with verification
3. Measure and report performance metrics
4. Provide formal verification where applicable
5. Ensure all success criteria are met
6. Update result.json with actual measurements
