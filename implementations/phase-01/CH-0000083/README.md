# Challenge CH-0000083: Image Processing Algorithms #83

**Category:** RENDERING  
**Difficulty:** EXTREME  
**Estimated Time:** 1w  
**Owner:** phase-01  

## Description

Filtering, enhancement, feature detection algorithms (Challenge CH-0000083)

## Success Criteria

- Image quality metrics
- Algorithm correctness
- Formal verification of correctness properties
- Performance analysis with complexity bounds

## Verification Method

BENCHMARK

## Dependencies



## Tags

image-processing, filtering, computer-vision

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - This challenge is currently a stub that fails intentionally.

## Usage

```bash
# Run the challenge (will fail until implemented)
./run.sh

# Verify the implementation (will fail until implemented) 
./verify.sh
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Replace the stub in `run.sh` with actual algorithm implementation
2. Add comprehensive unit tests with verification
3. Measure and report performance metrics
4. Provide formal verification where applicable
5. Ensure all success criteria are met
6. Update result.json with actual measurements
