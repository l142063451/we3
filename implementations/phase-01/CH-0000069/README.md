# Challenge CH-0000069: Dynamic Programming Solutions #69

**Category:** ALGORITHMIC  
**Difficulty:** TRIVIAL  
**Estimated Time:** 1h  
**Owner:** phase-01  

## Description

Solve optimization problems using DP with memoization (Challenge CH-0000069)

## Success Criteria

- Optimal substructure verification
- Space-time tradeoff analysis

## Verification Method

BENCHMARK

## Dependencies



## Tags

dynamic-programming, optimization, memoization

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - This challenge is currently a stub that fails intentionally.

## Usage

```bash
# Run the challenge (will fail until implemented)
./run.sh

# Verify the implementation (will fail until implemented) 
./verify.sh
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Replace the stub in `run.sh` with actual algorithm implementation
2. Add comprehensive unit tests with verification
3. Measure and report performance metrics
4. Provide formal verification where applicable
5. Ensure all success criteria are met
6. Update result.json with actual measurements
