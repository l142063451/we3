# Challenge CH-0000074: Special Function Computation #74

**Category:** MATHEMATICAL  
**Difficulty:** HARD  
**Estimated Time:** 1w  
**Owner:** phase-01  

## Description

Compute Bessel, gamma, elliptic functions with high precision (Challenge CH-0000074)

## Success Criteria

- Reference accuracy validation
- Efficient series convergence
- Performance analysis with complexity bounds

## Verification Method

FORMAL_PROOF

## Dependencies



## Tags

special-functions, analysis, numerical

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - This challenge is currently a stub that fails intentionally.

## Usage

```bash
# Run the challenge (will fail until implemented)
./run.sh

# Verify the implementation (will fail until implemented) 
./verify.sh
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Replace the stub in `run.sh` with actual algorithm implementation
2. Add comprehensive unit tests with verification
3. Measure and report performance metrics
4. Provide formal verification where applicable
5. Ensure all success criteria are met
6. Update result.json with actual measurements
