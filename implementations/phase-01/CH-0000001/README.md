# Challenge CH-0000001: Advanced Graph Algorithms #1

**Category:** ALGORITHMIC  
**Difficulty:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time:** 8h  
**Owner:** phase-01  

## Description

Implement shortest paths, maximum flow, minimum cut algorithms (Challenge CH-0000001)

## Success Criteria

- Optimal solution verification
- Complexity bounds met

## Verification Method

UNIT_TEST

## Dependencies



## Tags

graphs, optimization, algorithms

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - This challenge is currently a stub that fails intentionally.

## Usage

```bash
# Run the challenge (will fail until implemented)
./run.sh

# Verify the implementation (will fail until implemented) 
./verify.sh
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Replace the stub in `run.sh` with actual algorithm implementation
2. Add comprehensive unit tests with verification
3. Measure and report performance metrics
4. Provide formal verification where applicable
5. Ensure all success criteria are met
6. Update result.json with actual measurements
