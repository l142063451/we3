# Challenge CH-0000044: Ray Tracing Implementation #44

**Category:** RENDERING  
**Difficulty:** TRIVIAL  
**Estimated Time:** 1h  
**Owner:** phase-01  

## Description

Monte Carlo ray tracing with global illumination (Challenge CH-0000044)

## Success Criteria

- Visual quality metrics
- Convergence analysis

## Verification Method

UNIT_TEST

## Dependencies



## Tags

raytracing, monte-carlo, lighting

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - This challenge is currently a stub that fails intentionally.

## Usage

```bash
# Run the challenge (will fail until implemented)
./run.sh

# Verify the implementation (will fail until implemented) 
./verify.sh
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Replace the stub in `run.sh` with actual algorithm implementation
2. Add comprehensive unit tests with verification
3. Measure and report performance metrics
4. Provide formal verification where applicable
5. Ensure all success criteria are met
6. Update result.json with actual measurements
