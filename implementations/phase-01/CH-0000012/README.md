# Challenge CH-0000012: Symmetric Encryption Implementation #12

**Category:** CRYPTOGRAPHIC  
**Difficulty:** TRIVIAL  
**Estimated Time:** 8h  
**Owner:** phase-01  

## Description

Implement AES, ChaCha20 with test vectors validation (Challenge CH-0000012)

## Success Criteria

- Test vector compliance
- Side-channel resistance analysis

## Verification Method

BENCHMARK

## Dependencies



## Tags

aes, chacha20, encryption, test-keys-only

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - This challenge is currently a stub that fails intentionally.

## Usage

```bash
# Run the challenge (will fail until implemented)
./run.sh

# Verify the implementation (will fail until implemented) 
./verify.sh
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Replace the stub in `run.sh` with actual algorithm implementation
2. Add comprehensive unit tests with verification
3. Measure and report performance metrics
4. Provide formal verification where applicable
5. Ensure all success criteria are met
6. Update result.json with actual measurements
