# WE3 New Implementations - Comprehensive 9-Phase Program

**Project**: WE3 Research - Advanced Mathematical Computing Framework  
**Version**: 1.6+ Implementation Program  
**Date**: 2024-12-28  
**Authority**: GitHub Copilot Autonomous Agent  
**Goal**: Real implementations with evidence-based work, machine-verifiable artifacts

## MISSION STATEMENT

Create and execute a 9-phase program to produce real implementations, comprehensive testing, and machine-verifiable artifacts. All work must be evidence-based with no mock/placeholder implementations. Follow strict reproducibility requirements with container digests, hardware provenance, and formal verification.

## PRIORITY RULES (MUST OBEY)

1. **No privileged operations** without human-supplied signing keys and explicit approval
2. **No extraordinary claims** without:
   - Machine-checked formal proofs (Lean/Coq)  
   - Two independent reproductions from different groups
   - Explicit human sign-off recorded in memory.md
3. **No real cryptographic attacks** - synthetic keys only, responsible disclosure
4. **Reproducibility mandatory** - pinned containers, commit hashes, hardware provenance
5. **Stop on verification failure** - create remediation PR, do not proceed until fixed

## IMPLEMENTATION RULES (EVERY CHALLENGE)

Each challenge implementation at `implementations/phase-XX/CH-YYYYY/` must include:

1. **`run.sh`** - Deterministic reproduction script
2. **`verify.sh`** - Produces PASS/FAIL with deterministic artifact  
3. **`result.json`** - Performance metrics, verification status
4. **Hardware provenance** - `hardware.json` with system specs
5. **Container digest** - Pinned execution environment
6. **Artifact storage** - Push to artifact store with links
7. **Memory.md update** - Commit hash and artifact links

### Result.json Schema
```json
{
  "challenge_id": "CH-0000001",
  "commit": "git-sha",
  "container": "sha256:...",
  "hardware": { "cpu": "...", "memory": "...", "gpu": "..." },
  "timestamp": "2024-12-28T00:00:00Z",
  "execution_time": 1.23,
  "verification": "PASS|FAIL",
  "metrics": {
    "flops": 1000000,
    "memory_usage": 1024,
    "energy_j": 0.01
  },
  "precompute_cost": {
    "wall_time": 10.0,
    "storage_mb": 100,
    "amortization_factor": 1000
  }
}
```

## TESTING & BENCHMARKS (REAL HARDWARE ONLY)

- **Container Digests**: Pin all execution environments
- **Hardware Logging**: Complete `hardware.json` with CPU/GPU/memory specs  
- **PAPI/Perf Counters**: For numeric kernels with high-precision reference
- **Visual Verification**: Real engine scenes with PSNR/SSIM vs reference
- **Crypto Testing**: Synthetic keys only, proof-of-correctness required
- **No Simulation**: All performance from real hardware measurements

## FORMALIZATION & EXTRAORDINARY CLAIMS

Any claim affecting complexity theory or physics must:
- Be expressed as formal theorem with Lean4/Coq proof artifacts
- Have reproducibility from two independent labs  
- Receive legal/ethics/human sign-off clearance
- Mark in `research.md` as: PROVEN / VERIFIED / HEURISTIC / SPECULATIVE

## AUTOMATION & CI SCHEDULING

- **Fast Tests**: Unit tests on PRs
- **Integration**: Nightly integration tests
- **Heavy Benchmarks**: Scheduled batches with explicit cost approvals
- **10K Challenges**: Staggered CI execution (fast/medium/heavy categories)

## ARTIFACT FORMAT (MANDATORY)

Every result must include:
- `hardware.json` - Complete system specifications
- `container.digest` - Execution environment hash
- `stdout.log`, `stderr.log` - Complete execution logs
- `perf.data` - Performance counter data (if available) 
- `power.trace` - Power consumption data (if available)
- `result.json` - Structured metrics per schema above
- `verification` - Script producing PASS/FAIL determination
- `provenance` - Entry in `memory.md` with UTC timestamp, commit SHA, artifact links

## FAILURE POLICY

If `verify.sh` fails for any challenge:
1. Create blocking issue with failing test details
2. Create remediation PR with regression test  
3. Do not proceed with dependent tasks until fixed
4. Update challenge status to BLOCKED in registry

## ETHICS & SECURITY CONSTRAINTS

- **No real crypto attacks** - synthetic test keys only
- **Responsible disclosure** for any discovered vulnerabilities  
- **No OS/device security bypass** without human-supplied credentials and approval
- **No kernel modifications** - user-space implementations only
