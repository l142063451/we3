## Usage

Each version can be imported and used independently:

```python
# Import specific version
from vgpu import v16 as vgpu_16  # v1.6
from vgpu import v19 as vgpu_19  # v1.9
from vgpu import v20 as vgpu_20  # v2.0

# Get version information
import vgpu.1_9 as vgpu19
version_info = vgpu19.get_version()

# Initialize specific version
config = vgpu19.initialize_vgpu(log_level='INFO')
```

## Structure

Each version directory contains:
- `__init__.py` - Main module interface with version information
- Version-specific implementation files and directories
- Documentation and configuration files as applicable
