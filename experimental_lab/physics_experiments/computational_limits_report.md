## Key Findings

### Fundamental Constraints
1. **Thermodynamic Limits:** Landauer's principle sets minimum energy per computation
2. **Information Theory:** Shannon entropy bounds compression ratios
3. **Complexity Theory:** P ≠ NP implies exponential scaling for certain problems
4. **Quantum Simulation:** Classical simulation requires exponential resources
5. **Memory Bandwidth:** Physical limits constrain data transfer rates

### Implications for vGPU v1.5 Development
- Focus on algorithmic optimizations within physical constraints
- Improve energy efficiency approaching Landauer limit
- Optimize compression for specific data types (within Shannon bounds)
- Use heuristics and approximations for NP-hard problems
- Implement efficient memory access patterns

### Recommended Research Directions
1. **Reversible Computing:** Reduce energy consumption via reversible operations
2. **Approximate Algorithms:** Trade precision for speed in suitable applications
3. **Memory Hierarchy Optimization:** Exploit cache locality and prefetching
4. **Parallel Algorithm Design:** Maximize utilization of available cores
5. **Problem-Specific Optimizations:** Tailor algorithms to common use cases

### Scientific Integrity Statement
All experiments confirm fundamental limits of computation. Claims of 'infinite FLOPS',
'breaking Shannon limits', or 'solving P vs NP' violate established physics and mathematics.
vGPU v1.5 should focus on achievable optimizations within these constraints.
